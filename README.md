# magic-squares-permutations
A heuristic approach to find all Magic Squares for a given number. Once you reach a 6x6 grid you have 32134 valid permutations. Due to memory and cpu constraints any number greater than 6 was not viable, and thus the experiment to find all magic squares for a given number failed.

A heatmap of occurrence of numbers in found permutations that use the "magic constant" as the sum.

A more reasonable approach with less memory usage can be found
